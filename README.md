# SignalFlowGraph-GainSolver

Given a Signal Flow Graph, it can calculate the Gain, and can also draw the graph.

The singal flow graph is entered as a transmittace matrix.


## System Requirements

1. Python 3
2. SymPy (for Python 3) [Only needed for solving the Gain]
3. Any Web Browser with Javascript enabled [Only needed for drawing the graph]


## How to Install and Run (for both: User or Developer)

1. Ensure your system satisfies the System Requirements.
2. Clone/Download the repository on your system in any directory.
3. Run `mainGui.py`.
